Submitted by: **Urooj Ansari**

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [X] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [X] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [X] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [X] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [X] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [X] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
https://www.w3schools.com/

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
A  challenge that I encountered in creating this submission was the understanding of the functions being used and overall understanding how Javascript is used. To overcome it,
I began by reading what each of the functions entailed in the pre-work tabs that were provided and then went to other resources (i.e. w3schools) to further understand the 
usages of functions and the built-in libraries of Java. Additionally, another thing that I found tricky was the syntax of Java, as it is a little different from what I 
am used to. However, using what was given and other resources helped resolve those issues as well. 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
One question I have is: How could one make a website more interactive (adding a chat box, the option to call)? 
How can we use HTML/CSS/JS to make more involved (higher graphics, better designs) games?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would most likely mess around with the number of squares as the user progresses further into the game (increases the 
amount of "levels'' there are) and also increase the pace of the game as well. As the user progresses further and further into the game, there would be an increased pace in addition to more squares that they would need to keep track of.  I would also mess around with the frequency sounds as well (maybe adding in different sounds instead of general frequencies).
